#RideShare Bonus Points Problem: 
________________________________

A ride-sharing company provides reward points to its drivers every year 
at a fixed bonus rate. Each driver starts with an initial number of points. 
Every year, the points increase by a certain percentage (bonus rate).

Write a program that will take as input:
1. Initial reward points
2. Annual bonus rate (percentage)
3. Number of years (n)

Your program should calculate and print:
1. Points after one year
2. Points after two years
3. Points after n years (where n will be taken as input)

Example Input:
Enter initial points: 1000
Enter annual bonus rate (%): 10
Enter number of years: 3

Example Output:
Points after 1 year: 1100.00
Points after 2 years: 1210.00
Points after 3 years: 1331.00
