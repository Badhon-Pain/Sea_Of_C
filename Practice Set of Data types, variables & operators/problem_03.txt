________________________________

A Wi-Fi router is at point (x1, y1) in a building. A device is at 
point (x2, y2). The signal strength decreases at rate 8.12 Mb per unit
distance. Calculate the final speed when the reciever will recieve

Input: coordinates of router and device
Output: Speed of the network (3 decimal places)
