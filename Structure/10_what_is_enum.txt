An enumeration, or enum, is a user-defined data type in C that is used 
to assign names to a set of related constant integer values. In an enum, 
the first constant has the default value 0, and the subsequent constants 
increase by 1 automatically, although the programmer can explicitly 
assign custom values if needed. Using enums makes the code more readable 
and meaningful, since we can use descriptive names instead of numbers 
(for example, using Friday instead of remembering the value 5). 
Enums are commonly used to represent fixed sets of values such as days 
of the week, months, colors, or status codes.
