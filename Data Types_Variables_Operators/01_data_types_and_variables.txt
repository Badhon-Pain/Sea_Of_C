#Data Types and Variables
___________________________

## Data Types in C

### Primary Data Types
- `int`, `char`, `float`, `double`

Data Type	Size (typical, in bytes)	Description
int	               4	                Integer values (e.g., 5, -10)
char	           1	                Single character (e.g., 'A', 'b')
float	           4                    Single-precision floating point
double	           8	                Double-precision floating point

### Derived Data Types
- Array, Pointer, Structure

### Qualifiers
- `signed`, `unsigned`, `short`, `long`

## Variables
- Named memory locations to store data
- Rules for naming:
  1. Must start with a letter or underscore
  2. Can contain letters, digits, underscores
  3. Case-sensitive
  4. Cannot be a reserved keyword

##Types of Variables
Type	         Description
Local	         Declared inside a function; accessible only within it.
Global	         Declared outside functions; accessible anywhere.
Static	         Retains value between function calls.
Register	     Suggests storing in CPU register (faster access).

### Declaration and Initialization
```c
int age;
age = 20;
int price = 100;
