    Why use NULL? ## NULL = special value meaning “no address / empty pointer”.

   1. Safety purpose – if we give NULL instead of a garbage address to an uninitialized pointer
                       we can decrease bug of our programme

   2. To check – to check wheather the pointer is pointing to something or not
